Some python scripts to pull info from steam

Use -h on steam.py

The steam.py pulls stats about what games you own and play time
You need to edit this part 

api_key="<insert here>"
steam_id="<insert here>"

The other two don't need a key they just scrape the store pages for the top most popular games and for whats currently on sale.
